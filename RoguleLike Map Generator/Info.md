# More information about the project
This is part of a side project I started with a friend, which was a roguelike game where the player traverses a metro system. This script's purpose is to proceduraly generate metro maps with easily adjustable parameters such as number of lines and stations per line. Then some of the stations are merged so that lines have connections.
